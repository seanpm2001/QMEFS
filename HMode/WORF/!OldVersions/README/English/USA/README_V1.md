# W.O.R.F.

## What is W.O.R.F.?

W.O.R.F. (**W**rite **O**nce, **R**ead **F**orever) is a new data storage method that allows the user to write data once and allow the data to be stored without refreshing the device. It is a design that is estimated to let data last over 100 years, without the need to constantly rewrite data and replace hardware, as on traditional hard drives and solid state drives.

It is patented, but I will include it anyways, no-one should be able to prevent the usage of a hardware format in this way, and I am willing to fight to keep this standard open and accessible. It is like a hard drive, no-one should be able to patent how a hard drive works, and never let anyone use it.
